## What is Grade Notifier?

Great question! Let me highlight a few of our strengths:

|   |Features |
|---|---|
|üö®| Get Notifier when a new grade is posted |
|<img src=./Assets/CUNY-Logo.png width=30>| Available to all CUNY schools |
|üìß| Works with email (coming soon...) |
|üì±| Works with phone |
|‚è≥| Save time|
|üò∞| Reduce stress|
|üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶| Open source|

We aim to allow students to enjoy their vacation instead of checking every minute to see if their grades were released. We check every 5 minutes for you and notify you in case of a grade change. 

 
## How do I use Grade Notifier?

To get started head over to our website: [Grade-Notifier](https://venus.cs.qc.cuny.edu/~adeh6562/index.php)

The guide on the site should help you get started!

Hey! You're looking to contribute to Grade-Notifier? That's awesome!! This is a college project so the hope is that students over the years will help maintain it. If you're interested, the community thanks you!

2. Building out the script
3. DevOps, making sure the project doesn't hiccup

### I want to contribute but...

Reach out cunybot1@gmail.com or ehud.adler62@qmail.cuny.edu. We're happy to walk you through how git works, how the project is structured or anything else.

### Quickstart

> Requirements:
> - macOS/Linux
> - git installed
> - ruby installed (should come preloaded on those 2 OS)

If your looking to get going quickly checkout our Starter file. It can be downloaded here: [Grade-Notifier Starter file](https://gist.github.com/Huddie/e7e19d4f84a4e531944c25d6751cfe39/archive/77c0815b530659dde202b1d60f873e58a0c4d600.zip)


1. Make sure you have jumpstarter installed (This requires ruby gems) `gem install jump-starter`

2. Have your Github username and password on hand. 

3. Simply drag the Setup file (that you just downloaded) into the folder of your choice and run `jumpstart start` in your terminal (make sure your in the proper directory). 

Thats it! Your good to go!

## Open Source & Copying

We open source this repository for 2 main reasons:

1) We hope that a project like this will excite fellow students and give them a project to work on. We know getting started on projects can be tough and we hope this helps get you coding!

2) This project is susceptible to breakage at any point. Being that it relies on CUNYFirsts website the code and URL's are subject to changes and not in our control. For that reason, constant maintainence and updates could be necessary. As much fun as we had building this, we can't keep ontop of it. 

We have chosen to use the MIT License to allow students to make use of the code inside the project but **do not distribute this software commercially** paid or free.  


## FAQ

**Q: Do you store passwords?**<br>
A: No way! You password is never stored on our server and we never get a chance to see it. 

**Q: Do you store usernames?**<br>
A: Yes we do. In order to restrict users from signing in multiple times we keep track of which usernames are actively using the service. If you have any questions about that please contact me @ ehud.adler62@qmail.cuny.edu

**Q: Do you store any other information?**<br>
A: We retain the right to store any non-user specific data. For example, we will *NEVER* look at you and your grades but we may capture that some person got a A+ in a certain class. Again, your name will never be associated with that grade and we will have no way of knowing where that grade came from. If you have any questions about that please contact me @ ehud.adler62@qmail.cuny.edu

**Q: I signed up but didn't get an initial text**<br>
A: Wait a few more minutes sometimes the system are overloaded and the message takes time to send. If you still haven't received a message after 10 minutes it could be there was an issue, just try signing up again. If it persists, reach out. We're happy to help.
