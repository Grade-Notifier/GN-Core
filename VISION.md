# VISION

We have an ambitious goal of being a template, employed by multiple different schools. 
We don't see this project staying specific to any school. The crux of the Grade-Notifier is 3 mains things:

1. Requesting the grades of a specific student
2. Checking if a change in that users grades 
3. Notifying that user that a change has occured + what the changes are

Notice how not 1 of the 3 main purposes of the Grade-Notifier deals with actually getting those grades. (login, scraping etc...).
That job, we believe will ultimately be the job of a "Grade-Notifier-API". We hope to build the Grade-Notifier-API interface such that other developers
may, if they choose, implement the interface in a way that would enable Grade-Notifier to work for their school.

We additionally want to make setting up the project as easy as possible. That means deploying to their server of choice, updating the Grade-Notifier core when updates come out etc.

We believe that at the end of this project many schools will have a Grade-Notifier running backed by our Grade-Notifier core. 
We also believe that this project and the projects that come from this project will help student, CS and otherwise, 
get involved in their field and open them up to the world of open source.

We hope you join the project, and see out our vision with us.

Ehud.
